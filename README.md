Microarray Analysis Pipeline - Shiny Interface
Overview
The Microarray Analysis Pipeline is a Shiny-based web application that provides an interactive interface for analyzing microarray data. It allows users to:
•	Upload CEL files and assign sample groups
•	Perform quality control (QC) analysis with various plots
•	Run differential expression analysis and visualize results
•	Download results for further analysis
This pipeline is designed to simplify the microarray data analysis process for researchers and bioinformaticians.

Features
•	Data Upload: Supports uploading multiple CEL files and assigning experimental groups.
•	Quality Control: Generates RNA degradation plots, boxplots, MA plots, and density plots.
•	Differential Expression Analysis: Displays results in a table format and provides interactive volcano plots and heatmaps.
•	Downloadable Results: Users can download processed data and analysis results in CSV format.
•	User-Friendly Interface: Built using Shiny and Shiny Dashboard, making it accessible via a web browser.

Installation & Dependencies
The application requires R and several Bioconductor and CRAN packages.
Required R Packages
The following packages are installed automatically if they are missing:
•	shiny
•	shinydashboard
•	DT
•	plotly
Ensure you have Bioconductor installed before running the application.
To install dependencies manually, run:
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("BiocManager")

required_packages <- c("shinydashboard", "DT", "plotly")

for (package in required_packages) {
  if (!requireNamespace(package, quietly = TRUE))
    BiocManager::install(package)
}

How to Run the Application
1.	Install dependencies (if not already installed).
2.	Ensure the script microarray_pipeline.R is in the same directory as app.R.
3.	Open R and set the working directory to the folder containing the app.
4.	Run the following command in R:
5.	library(shiny)
6.	runApp("app.R")
7.	The application will launch in your default web browser.

Usage Guide
1️. Upload Data
•	Click on the "Upload Data" tab.
•	Upload your CEL files (raw microarray data).
•	Assign groups (e.g., control vs. treatment).
•	Specify an output directory.
•	Click "Run Analysis" to start the pipeline.
2️. Quality Control
•	Navigate to the "Quality Control" tab.
•	View diagnostic plots such as:
o	RNA degradation plots
o	Box plots
o	MA plots
o	Density plots
3️. View and Download Results
•	Go to the "Analysis Results" tab.
•	Select a comparison and view:
o	Differential expression table
o	Volcano plot
o	Heatmap of top 25 differentially expressed genes
•	Download the results as a CSV file.

Troubleshooting
•	Application doesn't launch?
o	Ensure you have installed all dependencies.
o	Run sessionInfo() in R to check for missing packages.
•	No results appear after clicking "Run Analysis"?
o	Verify that your CEL files are correctly uploaded and groups are assigned.
o	Check if microarray_pipeline.R is present in the directory.
•	Plots not displaying properly?
o	Ensure you have plotly installed correctly using install.packages("plotly").
